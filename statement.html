         <p id="ps">After a brief stint teaching, I have spent most of my adult life homeschooling my kids. I enjoyed those years very much because they allowed
            me to teach in an environment with virtually no restrictions. This meant that we could mummify chickens as part of our study of ancient Egypt, jump on
            the couch as we memorized poems, spend countless hours reaching together, and enjoy long afternoons at the park.

         <p id="ps"> As my boys grew, I realized that I needed a plan for the next stage of my life. I decided to update my familiarity with educational
            research by earning a graduate degree in curriculum and instruction. I also decided to take on part-time work to finance that project, and I was
            pleased to work on a variety of curricular projects. I initially balked when a client asked me to work on computing curriculum since I knew nothing
            about it. But they pressed, I eventually agreed, and the rest, as they say, is history.

         <p id="ps"> I wanted to continue my education, so I selected the doctoral program in Learning Technologies at UNT since it had a strong focus
            on computing. I was very pleased to begin working with Dr. Norris, whose expertise in computer science has benefited me greatly. I also
            appreciated delving into the philosophical aspects of the field with Dr. Warren and sharpening my data analysis skills with Dr. Lee. Throughout
            the entire program, Dr. Foshay has been an excellent sounding board.

         </div>
         <p id="ps"> I have also benefitted greatly from associations outside of the program. I have worked on two NSF-funded projects through SageFox
            Consulting, which specializes in STEM-related educational research. Through this work, I was able to network with specialists in computer
            science education as well as hone my research and project management skills. I have recently begun to work with the Teaching Systems Lab
            at MIT, where I have been deeply impressed by the various skill sets of my colleagues as we work to expand access to and equity within
            computer science education. Similarly, as a fellow in the Cultural Competence in Computing Program, I am currently expanding my knowledge
            in this important aspect of education.

         <p id="ps">The silver lining to being a graduate student during a pandemic is that online conferences have made it easier to participate with a minimum
            commitment of time and money, especially given the international nature of computer science education research. I feel that I have learned a lot
            from preparing for and presenting at over a dozen conferences. I have also benefitted from being a teaching assistant during every semester of my
            studies; in addition to working directly with students, this position has shaped my understanding of best practices for online learning.

         <p id="ps"> I am pleased with the fact that my work in computer science education research has not been overly narrow. I have performed qualitative
            research on historical interviews with female computer science pioneers as well as a content analysis on instructional materials; I have performed
            quantitative analysis on interviews with computer science professional development providers as well as data sets related to the Advanced Placement
            exams. I have developed tools for improving computing education as well as a tutorial for best practices for multimedia instructional materials.

         <p id="ps">My professional interest is, put simply, to improve computer science education for <i> all</i> students. I don't yet know
            whether my best fit will be found in higher education, a research lab, a non-profit, or industry. Regardless, I'd like to focus on ways
            to incorporate the learning sciences into improving computing education. It is a truism in this field that learning to program is hard;
            I'd like to work to transform it into what one computing education pioneer, Seymour Papert, called 'hard fun.'
